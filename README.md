# LD_PRELOAD Example

This folder is a simple demonstration on how LD_PRELOAD can be used to modify
the runtime behaviour of a given app.

In hte scenarion in which a target program cannot be easily recompiled, this is
really useful, since it requires the user just to recompile the preloaded
library.``
